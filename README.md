# Master Chief - Visual Studio Code Extension
Master Chief is a Visual Studio Code Extension by [Jonno Witts](https://www.jonnowitts.com).
It is an homage to **Halo Infinite** and has been inspired by the Master Chief's Mjolnir armour (and the pink and purple of the Needler).

Colours have been checked against the [WebAIM contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to try and ensure good contrast for usage. As much as possible I have attempted to achieve WCAG AAA contrast.

In addition to the colour theme I have created an Adobe XD tool to create your own VSCode colour schemes which can be found in the project folder.

## Making your own edits
If you want to edit the theme:
1. Open the folder in VSCode
2. Press `FN + F5` on Mac, `F5` on PC, this will start a debugging version that you can view changes in real time.
3. Make your edits in the json file under the **Theme** folder (Master Chief-color-theme.json), save when ever you want to view changes.
4. When you've finished editing, copy the entire folder called `JONNOWITTS.MASTER-CHIEF-X.X.X` (X.X.X Relates to whatever the current version is)
5. Paste the entire folder into the .vscode extension folder. On MacOS this can be found under `USERNAME/.vscode/extensions`.

### If a style is missing
If you want to add a colour that's not yet defined and don't know what it's called:
1. `CMD/Ctrl + P` to open the Command Palette
2. Search for "Developer: Inspect Editor Tokens and Scopes"
![Example of Inspect Editor Tokens and Scopes](images/inspect-editor-tokens-and-scopes.png)
3. Click on the thing you want to change. A pop-up will show that says the name of the thing you've clicked. In the bottom half of the box you should see "textmate scopes". This list will be the scope name you want to add in the color-theme.json file.
4. Once defined, you will see this in using the Inspect Editor Tokens and Scopes. For example, if you set a foreground colour this will now be displayed to you.
