# Master Chief - Visual Studio Code Extension
Master Chief is a Visual Studio Code Extension by [Jonno Witts](https://www.jonnowitts.com).
It is an homage to **Halo Infinite** and has been inspired by the Master Chief's Mjolnir armour (and the pink and purple of the Needler).

Colours have been checked against the [WebAIM contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to try and ensure good contrast for usage. As much as possible I have attempted to achieve WCAG AAA contrast.

In addition to the colour theme I have created an Adobe XD tool to create your own VSCode colour schemes which can be found in the project folder.
